          In today’s world, did you know that engineering professions that are associated with subjects such as gardening and environmental sustainability are on the rise? While most people consider those jobs to be unstable or infeasable, in reality they are becoming some of the most stable jobs in today’s world. This is one of the many reasons why my career goals in later life are to become an environmental engineer, and more specifically an agricultural engineer. My plans for achieving this goal are to continue going on the environmental path as I go through high school and college, find and apply to a college with plenty of majors in environmental engineering, and then apply for a job as an environmental engineer. The reason why I would like to become one is because I have always enjoyed engineering, biology, and gardening and I wanted to find a career that employs all of them, and environmental engineering is the best one.</p>
          <p>  Despite all of my enthusiasm for entering this career field, I am absolutely sure that entering and excelling in this field will not be easy. I know that I will need a lot of specific skills and experiences for this type of career, but thankfully I have also had a lot of experience with this field in my late school career as well. In Freshman year, I had to work hard and focus in order to get through my first year of robotics and complete my first computer science class (Computer Science Principles). In Sophomore year, I started getting more involved in robotics through joining a team, engineering through joining the Engineering Academy at my school and taking the class Principles of Engineering, and environmental subjects, such as the Green Earth Club as well as signing up for classes for Junior year. Between Sophomore and Junior year, I took the COSMOS summer program from UC Davis on Future Foods to learn more about current advanced agriculture techniques. In Junior year, I started getting a lot more involved in environmental topics through classes such as Environmental sustainability and AP Environmental Science, and with most of the pandemic out of the way, we could start putting more action into the Green Earth Club.</p>
          <!--8th grade stuff: In eighth grade, I had to use my creativity and adaptability to get through my robotics course, by building many simple machines. I also had to use my innovative and tolerant skills during my industrial design course, to be able to tolerate everyone else messing around and innovate the garden past what it had been. In the summer between eighth and ninth grades, I had to persist through a summer school course to advance my math level because of how rushed it was. -->
          <p>	During all of the aforementioned activities, I got to learn a lot about myself as well. The first time I was introduced to gardening and engineering mixed together was in 8th grade, when I took a class called Industrial Design in which we made a school garden, which helped me find my enjoyment for Agricultural Engineering. When I entered the robotics club for the first time, I first recognized how I could come up with interesting designs through tinkering with parts. Over the years of engineering classes I have taken, I figured out that I can be very good at designing when it comes to coming up with new project ideas and executing them. Along with that, I also have a few achievements from high school and partially middle school. My main achievement so far in school has been trying to uphold high grades. From 6th grade to 9th, I finished every quarter and semester with above a 3.5 grade point average, which did take a bit of a dip during Sophomore year during the pandemic, but has come back strong once again in Junior year. In between Sophomore and Junior year, I was able to attend the COSMOS summer program, and got to learn a lot about future foods and ways of sustainably growing them in agriculture. Currently, in Junior year, I have helped the Green Earth Club set up a functioning school garden which had a full harvest in the winter, and I will continue helping the club expand next year. I've also recently joined a new club focused on adding a fully automated greenhouse to DHS alongside the Green Earth Club garden, which should also help in my journey to Agricultural Engineering.</p></small>
       <!--mid school stuff:  took Industrial design, I really started to learn about how much I loved gardening and innovation and environmental studies. In taking extracurricular sports, I also learned that I and also pretty good at playing tennis, and in going-->

<!--Original Paragraph: Andres Silvera is a student at Dublin high school in Dublin, California. He is currently enrolled in Algebra II and a Computer Science Principles class. He has worked on software development projects using tools such as scratch and MIT app inventor. He is a member of the Gael Force Robotics club, where students gather to build and program robots for VEX robotics competitions. In his middle school years, he took engineering classes where he designed simple machines and efficient planters. He has experience with 3D printing, having designed and printed various items, including a scaled down model of an efficiently designed planter. Andres hopes to join the Dublin High engineering academy.-->
