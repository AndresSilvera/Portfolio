          In today’s world, did you know that engineering professions that are associated with subjects such as gardening and environmental studies are on the rise? While most people consider those jobs to be unstable or bad, in reality they are some of the most stable jobs on the rise in today’s world. This is one of the many reasons why my career goals in later life are to become an environmental engineer. My plans for achieving this goal are to continue going on the environmental path as I go through high school and college, find a college with plenty of majors in environmental engineering and apply there, and then apply for a job as an environmental engineer. The reason why I would like to become one is because I have always enjoyed engineering, biology, and gardening and I wanted to find a career that employs all of them, and environmental engineering is the best one.</p>
          <p>  Despite all of my enthusiasm for getting this career, I am one hundred percent sure that this job will not be easy. I know that I will need a lot of specific skills and experiences for this job. Thankfully, I have already been through a lot of experiences in my eighth and ninth grade years. In eighth grade, I had to use my creativity and adaptability to get through my robotics course, by building many simple machines. I also had to use my innovative and tolerant skills during my industrial design course, to be able to tolerate everyone else messing around and innovate the garden past what it had been. In the summer between eighth and ninth grades, I had to persist through a summer school course to advance my math level because of how rushed it was. In ninth grade, I had to and still have to be artistic and conscientious to help me get artistic projects done in robotics and with a good meaning, rather than just playing on my phone. Finally, I have to use my cautiousness to help me a bit through Computer Science Principles, so that I avoid projects that are too large or too work-heavy to not overwork myself.</p>
          <p>	Along with all of the aforementioned adjectives, I also got to learn a lot about myself while taking courses and extracurricular activities. When I took Industrial design, I really started to learn about how much I loved gardening and innovation and environmental studies. In taking extracurricular sports, I also learned that I and also pretty good at playing tennis, and in going into a robotics club this year, I learned about how creative and artistic Ican be when not taking orders, by just being bored and thinking of things to do. Along with that, I also have a few large achievements from middle school and partially high school. My main achievement so far in school is having a grade point average always above a 3.5. From 6th grade to 9th, every quarter and semester has had above a 3.5 grade point average, and an entry to the Principal’s honor roll. My second biggest achievement in middle school was getting a participation award for entering the Wells garden into the President’s environmental youth award. Those two are my main achievements in middle school, and I haven’t really been in high school long enough to get anything there. </p></small>

<!--Original Paragraph: Andres Silvera is a student at Dublin high school in Dublin, California. He is currently enrolled in Algebra II and a Computer Science Principles class. He has worked on software development projects using tools such as scratch and MIT app inventor. He is a member of the Gael Force Robotics club, where students gather to build and program robots for VEX robotics competitions. In his middle school years, he took engineering classes where he designed simple machines and efficient planters. He has experience with 3D printing, having designed and printed various items, including a scaled down model of an efficiently designed planter. Andres hopes to join the Dublin High engineering academy.-->
