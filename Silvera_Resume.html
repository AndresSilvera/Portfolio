        <h6>My Work Experience</h6>
        <p><small>In my whole school career, I have had many experiences altogether: some good and some bad, some useful and some pointless. However, I have definitely had plenty of experiences with work, internships, and volunteer hours. Most of my useful experiences have come in mid-late high school, when I was in the DHS green earth club, as well as the DHS Gael Force Robotics (GFR) club. I got my first and only internship to date when I got to intern for a robotics team to help them out with building and programming in preparation for a states competition, which eventually helped me get onto a team in late 2020 through to 2021. At first, interning was a bit unusual, but I got used to it, and I learned that internships can be a great way to gain experience in the real world with real world problems since they put you into the real world with real world problems. I have also had many volunteering experiences for both GFR and the DHS Green Earth Club. Currently, I have been able to volunteer twice in my freshman year before the Covid-19 pandemic came along, not at all in my Sophomore year as the pandemic was in full swing, and many more times in my Junior year as the pandemic started to fade and the Green Earth club bloomed back into action. I have volunteered twice at GFR and around 12ish times for the Green Earth Club as of June 2022. When I volunteered for the robotics club, both times I volunteered to help run the annual Battle of the Bay competition they hold at out school. I got to see the behind the scenes of the robotics competitions, spend time with others, and get a better insight into the mechanics of how these competitions are held. As for the green earth club, the majority of those volunteering experiences were in my Junior year, as that was when the heavy work for the club started happening. Most of these events consisted of coming after school to the garden, and working on various tasks there, whether that be setting up planter boxes, sowing seeds, designing layouts, gathering harvests, picking weeds, setting up fencing, cleaning up planter boxes, et cetera.<br><br>Now, moving on from my volunteer experience, I’d like to talk about the various guest speakers and field trips I have attended, both before and during the Engineering Academy.<br><br>In Freshman year, I got to listen to a few speakers that we had over the course of the first 2020 quarantine “break”. The first speaker, Cesar Nicola,  called all the way from South America to talk about a couple of types of software development called scrum and agile, which are used to help coordinate a team to get it to function best. The second speaker, Joe Vierra, met (online) with us to talk about business startups, how they work, what most of them get wrong, and how to fix them and make them into sustainable companies. Both of these speakers were pretty incisive, as they helped me see how to work with a team better while in the real world.<br><br></small></p>
        <h6>Academy Narrative</h6>
        <p><small>During my time in the engineering program, I have met a number of industry professionals through workplace field trips and guest speakers. Currently, I have been on two virtual field trips in sophomore year and eight guest speakers and virtual tours in Junior year. <br><br>My first field trip was a Livermore aviation tour, held by Jim Berry. In the Tour, we were shown the inner workings of an airplane hanger, how the pilots of airplanes transfer between flights, and the experiences of flying from current and old times. The field trip was surprisingly in depth and covered a lot of the different benefits and activities that a new pilot would do. It also showed off a way that planes were conceptualized and tested with the Robot Garden, which had students and young designers get to build and design small prototype planes and drones. Even though I myself am not looking forward to a career in aviation, I did really enjoy the field trip, as it showed the many benefits and opportunities that new pilots are allowed, and was overall very engaging and enjoyable.<br><br> <img src="Images/LvAviation.png"> <br>I also attended a guest talk with Gracie Ermi. The topic of the talk was about the intersection of machine learning and marine biology. When I was younger, I was always interested in marine biology and looking at the different types of marine mammals and fish, so I thought it would be interesting to see machine learning being used in marine biology to locate whales. Recently at the time, I had gone on a whale watching trip in Monterey bay, so I know that it can be difficult to spot and identify whales from the surface, so seeing machine learning being used to spot and track whales in order to protect them seems very interesting. <br><br>The first virtual field trip I attended in my Junior year was a virtual tour of a wastewater treatment plant with Judy Zavadil. In this field trip, she went through all the various parts of the nearest wastewater treatment plant at our school. She showed us the preparatory stage, the primary treatment, the secondary treatment, and what happens after the water is filtered. In the preparatory stage, they filter out the large solids and send them to landfill. In the primary treatment, they filter out even finer solids through a slow moving conveyer where the particles can settle into layers. In the secondary treatment, they put the water through nutrient cleaning bacteria and infuse the water with oxygen so the bacteria can grow and thrive. Finally, the cleaned water is sent to a chemical treatment plant to prepare it to become recycled water, also known as tertiary treatent. This was definetly an interesting field trip, as I had not put much thought into wastewater prior to then.<br><br> The second virtual talk I attended in Junior year was a talk by Stephen McCord on local water issues. This presentation was more of a general presentation covering environmental science and study areas, and specifically which areas need to be covered when talking about water management in the future. The areas he talked about for water management were groundwater managing, water conservation and reuse, dam safety, lake quality, automated monitoring, data management, and climate change resistance. He also talked about some of the various trips he has been on around the world helping other places with their local water issues such as Australia, Africa, and various places in the Americas.<br><br>I hope that you found this presentation useful. Below, I have linked a PDF of my resume. Thank you so much for reading.</small></p>
