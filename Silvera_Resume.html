        <h6>My Work Experience</h6>
        <p><small>In my whole school career, I have had many experiences altogether: some good and some bad, some useful and some pointless. However, I have definitely had plenty of experiences with work, internships, and volunteer hours. Most of my useful experiences have come in late high school, when I was in the DHS green earth club, as well as the DHS Gael Force Robotics (GFR) club. I got my first and only internship to date when I got to intern for a robotics team to help them out with building and programming in preparation for a statewide competition. At first, interning was a bit unusual, but I got used to it, and I learned that internships can be a great way to gain experience in the real world with real world problems since they put you into the real world with real world problems. I have also had my fair share of volunteering both for GFR as well as the green earth club. I only volunteered twice though, once at each club, but each time was useful in their own way. When I volunteered for the robotics club to help run the competition, I got to see the behind the scenes of the robotics competitions, spend time with others, and learn why I should volunteer, because before that point I preferred not to volunteer, and after that point, I learned how useful volunteering can be to high school. When the next opportunity to volunteer came at the green earth club came, I took it up and volunteered to help start a garden, which mostly just let me learn how to cooperate better with others. </small></p>
