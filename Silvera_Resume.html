        <h6>My Work Experience</h6>
        <p><small>In my whole school career, I have had many experiences altogether: some good and some bad, some useful and some pointless. However, I have definitely had plenty of experiences with work, internships, and volunteer hours. Most of my useful experiences have come in mid-late high school, when I was in the DHS green earth club, as well as the DHS Gael Force Robotics (GFR) club. I got my first and only internship to date when I got to intern for a robotics team to help them out with building and programming in preparation for a statewide competition, which eventually helped me get onto a team in late 2020 through to 2021. At first, interning was a bit unusual, but I got used to it, and I learned that internships can be a great way to gain experience in the real world with real world problems since they put you into the real world with real world problems. I have also had a few volunteering experiences for both GFR and the green earth club. Currently, I have been able to volunteer twice in my freshman year before the Covid-19 pandemic came along, and twice in my Junior year as the pandemic started to fade.I volunteered once at GFR and thrice for the green earth club, and each time was useful in their own way. When I volunteered for the robotics club to help run the competition in my freshman year, I got to see the behind the scenes of the robotics competitions, spend time with others, and learn why I should volunteer, because before that point I preferred not to volunteer, and after that point, I learned how useful volunteering can be to high school. When the next opportunity to volunteer came at the green earth club came, I took it up and volunteered to help start a garden, and we picked weeds and prepared the area for a garden, and the experience mostly just let me learn how to cooperate better with others. In mid 2021, when we were given permission to work on the garden again, I got to voluneer 2 more times, once to build the first few planters and start planting, and a second time to build two more planters and add more plants (keep in mind this is from the start of junior year, so more volunteering oppourtunities are to come)<br><br>Now, moving on from work for a moment, I’d like to talk about a few speakers that we had over the course of the first 2020 quarantine “break”, since I have yet to go to any speakers in Sophomore year. The first speaker, Cesar Nicola,  called all the way from South America to talk about a couple of types of software development called scrum and agile, which are used to help coordinate a team to get it to function best. The second speaker, Joe Vierra, met (online) with us to talk about business startups, how they work, what most of them get wrong, and how to fix them and make them into sustainable companies. Both of these speakers were pretty incisive, as they helped me see how to work with a team better while in the real world.<br><br> The final experience that I would like to talk about today is my experience with mentors. I’m currently an early Junior, and we will start the academy mentoring program soon. Thus, the only "mentorship" program I’ve had is the Freshman mentoring program, also known as FMP, since there wasn't any mentorship programs over the Covid-19 pandemic in Sophomore year. In FMP, there wasn’t much to learn, since the time was mostly used for schoolwide updates and news, games, and rarely a party. The only real usable skills that I gained out of FMP was social skills, since I learned to play nicer with others and not to distance myself from everyone I meet. Other than that, I didn’t gain any academic skills from FMP. Hopefully in the coming years, I can get a mentorship that teaches adacdemic skills, but for now, I'll have to wait. <br><br></small></p>
        <h6>Academy Narrative</h6>
        <p><small>During my time in the engineering program, I plan to meet a number of industry professionals through workplace field trips and guest speakers. Currently, I have been on two virtual field trips in sophomore year.<br><br>My first field trip was a Livermore aviation tour, held by Jim Berry. In the Tour, we were shown the inner workings of an airplane hanger, how the pilots of airplanes transfer between flights, and the experiences of flying from current and old times. The field trip was surprisingly in depth and covered a lot of the different benefits and activities that a new pilot would do. It also showed off a way that planes were conceptualized and tested with the Robot Garden, which had students and young designers get to build and design small prototype planes and drones. Even though I myself am not looking forward to a career in aviation, I did really enjoy the field trip, as it showed the many benefits and opportunities that new pilots are allowed, and was overall very engaging and enjoyable.<br><br> <img src="Images/LvAviation.png"> <br>I also attended a guest talk with Gracie Ermi. The topic of the talk was about the intersection of machine learning and marine biology. When I was younger, I was always interested in marine biology and looking at the different types of marine mammals and fish, so I thought it would be interesting to see machine learning being used in marine biology to locate whales. Recently, I went on a whale watching trip in Monterey bay, so I know that it can be difficult to spot and identify whales from the surface, so seeing machine learning being used to spot and track whales in order to protect them seems very interesting. <br><br>I hope that you found this presentation useful. Below, I have linked a PDF of my resume. Thank you so much for reading.</small></p>
