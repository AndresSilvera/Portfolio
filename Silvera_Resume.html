        <h6>My Work Experience</h6>
        <p><small>In my whole school career, I have had many experiences altogether: some good and some bad, some useful and some pointless. However, I have definitely had plenty of experiences with work, internships, and volunteer hours. Most of my useful experiences have come in late high school, when I was in the DHS green earth club, as well as the DHS Gael Force Robotics (GFR) club. I got my first and only internship to date when I got to intern for a robotics team to help them out with building and programming in preparation for a statewide competition. At first, interning was a bit unusual, but I got used to it, and I learned that internships can be a great way to gain experience in the real world with real world problems since they put you into the real world with real world problems. I have also had my fair share of volunteering both for GFR as well as the green earth club. I only volunteered twice though, once at each club, but each time was useful in their own way. When I volunteered for the robotics club to help run the competition, I got to see the behind the scenes of the robotics competitions, spend time with others, and learn why I should volunteer, because before that point I preferred not to volunteer, and after that point, I learned how useful volunteering can be to high school. When the next opportunity to volunteer came at the green earth club came, I took it up and volunteered to help start a garden, which mostly just let me learn how to cooperate better with others. <br><br>Now, moving on from work for a moment, I’d like to talk about a few recent speakers that we had over the course of the quarantine “break.” The first speaker, Cesar Nicola,  called all the way from south america to talk about a couple of types of software development called scrum and agile, which are used to help coordinate a team to get it to function best. The second speaker, Joe Vierra, met (online) with us to talk about business startups, how they work, what most of them get wrong, and how to fix them and make them into sustainable companies. Both of these speakers were pretty incisive, as they helped me see how to work with a team better while in the real world.<br><br> The final experience that I would like to talk about today is my experience with mentors. So far, since I’m only a freshman, the only mentorship program I’ve had is the Freshman mentoring program, also known as FMP. In FMP, there wasn’t much to learn, since the time was mostly used for schoolwide updates and news, games, and rarely a party. The only real usable skills that I gained out of FMP was social skills, since I learned to play nicer with others and not to distance myself from everyone I meet. Other than that, I didn’t gain any academic skills from FMP. Hopefully in the coming years, I can get a mentorship that teaches adacdemic skills, but for now, I'll have to wait. <br><br>I hope that you found this presentation useful. Below, I have linked a PDF of my resume. Thank you so much for reading.</small></p>
