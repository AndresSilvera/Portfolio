            <small>For this project, the creation of the garden on an autodesk inventor was completely unrequired. The actual project was to design a tool that would benefit the environment as well as benefit consumers, and putting it through a shark-tank like game. I chose to design it on an autodesk inventor because it seemed like an extra challenge that I could accomplish. The autodesk inventor that I chose to use in this project was Tinkercad. Using Tinkercad, I designed each part of the garden individually, and the larger parts were designed in sections. This was because I had just received a 3d printer for christmas, and I wanted to use it to print the model. However, the main challenge I faced was printing all the pieces on time, since the 3d printer was not fast at all, and when the day before the due date came, I did manage to get and fasten the parts on time. The main skills I learned from this were printing efficiently using my own printer and how to attach 3d printed parts to each other.</small>
