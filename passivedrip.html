            <strong>Project:</strong> ES Final Group Project (Passive Drip Irrigation)<br>
            <strong>Course:</strong> Environmental Sustainability<br>
            <strong>Duration:</strong> 37 days (April 13 2022 - May 19 2022)<br>
            <strong>Objective:</strong> Design a system that can deliver water to a sizeable area of farmland without using any electricity or manual labor.<br>
            <strong>Type of project:</strong> Group project (1 partner)
            <br><em><a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/17HdEaWtn6ze3ywq977NMXh7u_BaU_wei1W6njk6jabg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> Documentation...</a></em><br><br>
            <small> This project acted as the final for this class, and we were assigned to find a solution to a problem that bothered us and solve it using engineering. The issue I focused on was the issue of distributing water to plants in a large garden without access to any electricity and avoiding any manual labor. My initial design was to use evaporation and gravity through a combination of a large pool, a tipping bucket, and drip irrigation pipes to deliver still water to the plants. After a bit of a dead period of not working due to AP tests, I partnered with Hayden to make the full presentation describing the concept. I did most of the heavy lifting when it came to making design choices about the system, and Hayden worked mostly on the presentational aspect of the project. After the initial concept, I mostly just ironed out the small quirks in the design through more designing, such as shaping the containers and exteriors for the pool of water and the tipping bucket to make it feasable and more efficient. I also made design sketches and even 3D printed a model of the the pipes to test that my design would work by sending a rush of water all at once through thin pipes to distribute it as evenly as possible, and it did end up working. If we had more time to work on this project, all that would be left would be mostly testing other parts of the system further and in conjunction and eventually testing the full model on a full field.</small>
