            <strong>Project:</strong> The easy image editing system in PIL python<br>
            <strong>Course:</strong> Computer Science Principles (CSP)<br>
            <strong>Duration:</strong> 5 days (March 20 2020- March 25 2020)<br>
            <strong>Objective:</strong> Create a python program that could manipulate images in any way that the client liked.<br>
            <strong>Type of project:</strong> Individual project<br><br>
            <small> For this project, The only thing that was required in the instructions was a code that could manipulate images. However, I wasnâ€™t completely satisfied with just these instructions, so I took the project a step further by trying to make the code as user friendly as possible. Using some concepts borrowed from a previous smaller project, I designed the user interface to appear in stages, with each stage letting the user decide what edits to perform on the image. I also tried to give as many options to the user as possible in this project by adding 4 different ways to edit the images, and adding 16 colors to the project when the edit needed color. While in theory this project should have been very easy to make, in practice it took a lot longer because of many problems occurring during this project, with the main one being that it was the first CSP project due during the coronavirus quarantine, and no one really knew what to do, which made the project harder by throwing a lot of requirements and instructions into obscurity. Another problem I ran into was that I had to do multiple different edits rather than just one and I had to troubleshoot each of them individually, both of which took a lot of time. Luckily, I managed to finish the project before it was considered late, and I managed to overcome all of the issues in the way of the project.
