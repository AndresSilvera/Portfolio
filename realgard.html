            <strong>Project:</strong> The Wells Garden<br>
            <strong>Course:</strong> Industrial Design<br>
            <strong>Duration:</strong> Approximately 4 months (late January 2019 - late May 2019)<br>
            <strong>Objective:</strong> Design and create a functional garden<br>
            <strong>Type of project:</strong> Class project<br><br>
            <small>    This project was started by my industrial design teacher, Ms Barton, to give wells something eco-friendly. A few years prior, the school had a program called Go-Greener, which made students recycle in 6th grade, but after some backlash it got cancelled, so Ms Barton came up with an idea to regain a program that was eco-friendly,which was the garden. The role I played in making the garden was Lead Designer, since I designed most of the plans for the garden and came up with many ways to improve it. One of the main challenges I faced here was even spacing between the planters, which I overcame by using my 3d printer to print a replica of the future garden with correctly scaled movable parts which were used to outline what the garden would look like. The garden took about 2 months to prepare for the plants, and the rest of the time was used for planting and waiting. As of today, I am no longer a member of this project, as it still goes on at wells without me, but my influence will still be there. Some of the skills I learned here were growing plants efficiently and better cooperation with others.</small>
