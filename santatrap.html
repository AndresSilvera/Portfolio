            <strong>Project:</strong> Compound Machine<br>
            <strong>Course:</strong> Honors Principles of Engineering<br>
            <strong>Duration:</strong> 25 days (November 9 2020 - December 4 2020)<br>
            <strong>Objective:</strong> Creating a Rube Goldberg machine using at least 15 simple machines<br>
            <strong>Type of project:</strong> Group project (5 members)<br><br>
            <small>The main point of this project was to utilize simple machines to create a Rube Goldberg machine with the theme of trapping Santa. A Rube Goldberg Machine is a complex set of simple machines that is used to complete a single task. In this project, me and my 4 group members struggled a little bit near the start of the project, as this was one of our first projects done completely over online school, which made task distribution complicated to say the least. Near the end of the project, we finally managed to pull ourselves together and put together some brainstormed designs in order to make a cohesive design. My part in the project was to design and create the last 3 sets of machines, and since there was a rule of 3 machines per group member, I had to create a design incorporating 9 simple machines in all. Within about a full day of noncontinuous work, I managed to design, create, test, and finalize my part of the Rube Goldberg machine while keeping the design to appear to be in 3 independent parts. Overall, I really enjoyed this project, as I got to test my creativity in managing to incorporate all of the machines with limited space, materials, and time.</small>
