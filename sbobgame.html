            <small> For this summer project, I had to reacreate a simple video game in which you play as spongebob and try to collect as many falling coins as possible and add my own twist onto it, using the Java programming language in the Greenfoot runner. However, I didn't just want to add one or two small little features and call it a day, I wanted to make the game an actually engaging and interesting video game with throught out characters, well designed aesthetics, and competent balancing. I started by giving functionality to the unused net textures by giving them the ability to trap Spongebob if they landed on him, as well as letting them spawn on the top of the screen, either at a random position or directly on top of Spongebob. I then added a new character from the show Spongebob Squarepants, his pet snail Gary, who would slowly come in from the left, hand Spongebob a few coins and scurry off. To compensate for the buff, I added another character, Mr Krabs, who would come in quickly from the right and snatch coins from Spongebob upon touching him. Finally, to balance Mr Krab's rampage, I gave Spongebob the ability to jump, and the ability to fall onto the ground. Throughout the process, I made sure to balance all of the features with each other, so Spongebob was faster than Gary but slower than Mr. Krabs, and that Mr Krabs took less coins than Gary gave Spongebob to compensate for his difficulty. Also, for the user experience, I added a coin count on the left and a 60 second timer to give a challenge in collecting as many coins as possible in the given time. </small>
