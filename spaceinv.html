            <strong>Project:</strong> Space Invaders<br>
            <strong>Course:</strong> Computer Science Principles<br>
            <strong>Duration:</strong> 17 days (September 23 2019 - October 9 2019)<br>
            <strong>Objective:</strong> Creating a game using block code<br>
            <strong>Type of project:</strong> Partner project<br><br>
            <small>In this project, me and a partner, Shreyas Lad, worked together to make an app using MIT App Inventor. The app we chose was the game Space invaders because it seemed like a cool project to make. At the start of the project, Shreyas was the hardest working, since he started off everything in the project, while I helped him a bit using design decisions. After a while, I got a bit bored with doing nothing for the project, so one night I powered through sleeping and spent a long time working on this, implementing many needed features such as bombs. However, the main challenge for us both were the bombs, since we couldnâ€™t find a way to make them work. Even our teacher was stumped. On the day the project was due, we decided to remove the bomb from the game because it was causing too many errors, but the game was still good because of all the other features we had added earlier. The main skills that I learned from this experience were more advanced programming skills in MIT App Inventor and better close teamwork and cooperation.</small>
